## Becoming an Editor

This community welcomes contributions. Interested contributors are encouraged to
progress to become editors. To become an editor the following steps
occur, roughly in order.

- The proposed editor establishes their reputation in the community,
  including authoring five (5) significant merged pull requests, and expresses
  an interest in becoming an Editor for the registry.
- A PR is created to update this file to add the proposed editor to the list of active editors.
- The PR is authored by an existing editor or has a comment on the PR from an existing editor supporting the proposal.
- The PR has a comment of support for the governing authority for the registry.
- Once the PR and necessary comments have been received, an approval time frame begins.
- The PR **MUST** be communicated on all appropriate communication channels, including relevant community calls, chat channels and mailing lists. Comments of support from the community are welcome.
- The PR is merged and the proposed maintainer becomes a maintainer if either:
  - Two weeks have passed since the required comments and minimum number of editor approvals have been recorded, OR
  - A minimum of comments and an absolute majority of editors have approved the PR.
- If the PR does not get the requisite PR approvals, it may be closed.
- Once the PR has been merged, any necessary updates to the GitHub Teams are made.

## Removing Editors

Being an editor is not a status symbol or a title to be carried
indefinitely. It will occasionally be necessary and appropriate to move an
editor to emeritus status. This can occur in the following situations:

- Resignation of an editor.
- Violation of the Code of Conduct warranting removal.
- Inactivity.
- Other circumstances at the discretion of the other Editors or the governing authority over the registry.

The process to move an editor from active to emeritus status is comparable to the process for adding an editor, outlined above. In the case of voluntary
resignation, the Pull Request can be merged following an editor's PR approval. If the removal is for any other reason, the following steps **SHOULD** be followed:

- A PR is created to update this file to move the editor to the list of emeritus editors.
- The PR is authored by, or has a comment supporting the proposal from, an existing editor and/or the governing authority of the registry.
- Once the PR and necessary comments have been received, the approval time frame begins.
- The PR **MAY** be communicated on appropriate communication channels, including relevant community calls, chat channels and mailing lists.
- The PR is merged and the editor transitions to editor emeritus if:
  - The PR is approved by the editor to be transitioned, OR
  - Two weeks have passed since at least the governing authority and a minimum number of editor PR approvals have been recorded, OR
  - An absolute majority of maintainers have approved the PR.
- If the PR does not get the requisite PR approvals, it may be closed.

Returning to active status from emeritus status uses the same steps as adding a
new editor. Note that the emeritus editor already has the required
significant changes as there is no contribution time horizon for those.
